<h1>WEBSITE USER FLOW ></h1>

The user flow that we tried to maintain is,

home -> -> Signup -> create user Id-> Enter email details -> 
Enter password -> Login -> Dashboard -> Add Notes -> View a single note & Update Note(if you wish) -> Delete Notes(if you wish)

 <h1>MESSAGE></h1>
 I really enjoyed this whole part of developing as this was my first full stack MERN project and I have given the best efforts to bring the BEST thing as POSSIBLE.
 Wait for future updates.



 -- Updates in planning:
 - Search functionality to search notes quickly
 - Login with google
 - Dark Mode
